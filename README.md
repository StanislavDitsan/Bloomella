2. Product Catalog: We offer an extensive selection of fresh flowers, bouquets, plants and gift baskets that cater to different customer preferences and budgets.

3. Product Management: It's important to define product attributes, use high-quality product images, optimise for SEO, set pricing, categories, rating and monitor performance.

5. Fulfillment and Delivery: We partner with reliable logistics companies to ensure timely and secure delivery of our products to customers specified locations.

6. Customer Support: We prioritise excellent customer service by offering support via phone, email, and support form.

7. Save for later: This feature is particularly useful for customers who are still in the browsing phase, comparing prices and options, or waiting for a special occasion to make their purchase. By allowing customers to save their items for later, we give them the flexibility and convenience to come back to our store whenever they are ready to complete their purchase, without having to search for the products again.

8. Profile Page: The profile page allows customers to provide us with their personal information, such as their name, address, and contact details, which we can use to personalise their shopping experience and communicate with them more effectively. Manage their account, view order history. The profile page helps us collect customer information and improve our products and services while offering convenience and control to our customers.

9. Testimonials : The use of testimonials is an important part of our business model, as it helps us to build trust, provide social proof, improve SEO, and identify areas for improvement. We are committed to providing the best possible experience for our customers, and we believe that their feedback is an essential part of achieving this goal.

10. Suggested Products: Customers will be offered the option of selecting a suggested category for their purchasing experience while shopping.

11. Out of stock: This model ensures that the selected product cannot be added to the cart and purchased, hence avoiding customer frustration.

12. Customer profile deletion: We take customer privacy very seriously. By providing a simple and transparent process for profile deletion, we aim to build trust with our customers and ensure that their personal data is handled with care and respect.

13. Privacy Policy: We believe in providing clear and transparent policies that help our customers to understand their rights and obligations. We are committed to providing excellent customer service and strive to ensure that our policies are easily accessible, reasonable, and consistent with industry standards.

# Bugs

## During the process of working on this project, I encountered a few bugs.

1. The webhook failed to deliver ***payment_intent.succeeded*** after the order was completed, preventing the customer from receiving confirmation details via email.

### How did i solve this problem?

- I updated def handle_payment_intent_succeeded ***full_name*** with correct order.

<p align="center">

2. A minor bug caused by the Mailchimp embed form on the mobile page to cause a slight zoom on the main page. 

This is the source of the problem. 

```<!-- real people should not fill this in and expect good things - do not remove this or risk form bot signups-->
<div style="position: absolute; left: -5000px;

"aria-hidden="true"><input type="text"
                        name="b_f287a8cd8b7a95cb3fdef82b8_9f3b075d89" tabindex="-1" value="">

</div>
```

### How did i solve this problem?

- I opted not to touch it because it stops bot signups.

# Deployment

##  Github & Gitpod

To deploy my Django application, I used the [Code Institute Python Essentials Template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/python-essentials-template) available on Github. 

To get started, 
- I clicked on the "Use This Template" button and created a new repository with a name and brief description.
- I then created a Gitpod workspace by clicking on the "Gitpod" button, which took a few minutes to set up.

To work on the project, I opened the workspace from Gitpod rather than Github to ensure that I opened my previous workspace rather than creating a new one.

- I also pinned the workspace to prevent it from being deleted.

To commit my work, I made sure to do so often and used clear and explanatory commit messages. Specifically, I used the following commands:

- git add . : adds all modified files to the staging area

- git commit -m "A message explaining your commit" : commits all changes to a local repository

- git push : pushes all committed changes to the Github repository

If I wanted to make changes to my repository without affecting the original, I could create a copy of it by forking it.

This creates a new repository that is linked to the original, allowing me to make changes without affecting the original repository.

To clone my Github repository, 

- I first copied the link from the "Code" button dropdown on the repository page. 

- I then opened Gitpod and selected the directory where I wanted to create the clone. 

- Using the terminal, I typed "git clone" followed by the copied link from Github and pressed enter. 

This created a local clone of the repository that I could work on and use to backup my work.


## ElephantSQL

- Log in with GitHub and create a new instance at ElephantSQL.

- Once the project instance has been created, copy the URL.

- This value can also be saved as an environment variable and used in settings.py to equal the DATABASES variable.

- Install the dj-database-url package with  pip3 install dj_database_url==0.5.0 psycopg2

- then update the requirements.txt. pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt


## Creating an Application with Heroku

To deploy the website to a live server, Heroku was used as the hosting 
platform. 

 The first step involved creating the relevant files needed for Heroku to install the project dependencies, using the command 

 - pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt.
 
Additionally, a Procfile is required with a name of your project

- web: gunicorn bloomella.wsgi:application

Once the necessary files were created, the next step was to 

- go to Heroku.com and log in, or create an account if one didn't already exist. 

From there, the "New" dropdown was clicked and 

- "Create New App" was selected. A unique name was entered for the new project, with the option to change it if needed.

- Finally, the region where the project would be hosted was selected, taking into consideration factors such as user location and server availability.

After creating the Heroku app, the next step was to 
- connect it to the project's Git repository using the Heroku CLI. 

This involved adding the Heroku remote to the Git repository and pushing the code to the Heroku server. 

Once the code was pushed, the Heroku server automatically detected the project dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file and installed them accordingly. 

Finally, the necessary configuration settings were added to the Heroku dashboard, such as environmental variables and database connections.

- In the Settings tab, click on Reveal Config Vars and set the following variables:

1. AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID - AWS key

2. AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY

3. DATABASE_URL - Postgres key

4. EMAIL_HOST_PASS - Email info

5. EMAIL_HOST_USER

6. SECRET_KEY - Application secret key

7. STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY

8. STRIPE_SECRET_KEY

9. STRIPE_WH_SECRET

10. USE_AWS = True

## Heroku Deployment & GitHub project linking:

By following these steps, you can link your Github repository to your Heroku account:

- Select Github-Connect to Github from the Deploy tab.

- Type the name of the GitHub repository and then select Search.

- Click Connect after selecting the appropriate repository for your application.

- The project can then be deployed manually or automatically; manual deployment calls for you to click the Deploy Branch button each time you wish a change to be made. Automatic deployment will push and deploy application every time a modification is sent to Github.

- Your application will be built once you have selected your deployment method and hit Deploy Branch.

- Click the View button to launch your application.
